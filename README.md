## How to install

Until the Chrome Store approves the extension you must follow these steps:

2. Extract the zip
3. Enable Developer mode in the Chrome extensions tab

4. Click on "Load unpacked"
5. Select the folder where you downloaded and extracted the source code. This should be the same folder where the `manifest.json` file is (although you may not see it in the popup)
